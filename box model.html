The tradition of celebrating the Maratha king’s Jayanti was continued by renowned freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak. He was the one who highlighted the contributions of Shivaji among people.
The great warrior king was named after the native Goddess Shivai, who had granted his mother's wish for a son. Shivaji Maharaj is remembered and praised for his valour, warfare tactics and well-structured civil administration system.
In his regime, Shivaji always supported regional languages such as Marathi and Sanskrit. His contribution to Indian history makes him a hero of the country and a role model of many.</p>
